Welcome back to the final part in our tutorial on osTicket. Now that we have installed osTicket and configured it to add all of our SLA plans, end-users, teams, and departments, we can now "open" and "close" tickets, as well as generally explore the osTicket interface. If you've installed everything properly, you can go to the end-users osTicket URL: http://localhost/osTicket/. It will show what the end-user sees and how they can open a new ticket.

We can then see how a user opens up a new ticket and fills out all the information, the type of help topic, the issue summary, and any additonal comments.

While we are in the agent panel, we can go to the overview, and see all the tickets that are open and what needs to be resolved, we can also see the priority and who the tickets are assigned to. We can also see any updates and the datee and time as to when it was last updated.

Let's look at this ticket for example, from Julie, talking about how her entire sales department cannot access Microsoft Teams after an software upgrade the previous night. We can see the status, priority, which department it is assigned to, the agent it is assigned to, as weel as the SLA plan and when this ticket should be resolved by. We can also see what comments some of the IT team has made on this.

And once our ticket is resolved is removed from whatever tickets we have open.
